#this is a program to obtain the largest prime factor of 600851475143
#the number is too big though, therefore, I will be starting off with 30
#the answer should be 2,3,5
#the task is too big
#therefore, i will try to get the first 5 prime numbers as a sequence

#step 1 - program to get the first 5 prime numbers as a sequence
#attempt 2

y=c()
