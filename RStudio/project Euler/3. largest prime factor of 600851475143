#this is a program to obtain the largest prime factor of 600851475143
#the number is too big though, therefore, I will be starting off with 30
#the answer should be 2,3,5
#the task is too big
#therefore, i will try to get the first 5 prime numbers as a sequence

#step 1 - program to get the first 5 prime numbers as a sequence
#attempt 2
n=1
x=1
y=c()
for (n in 1:5)
{while (x in 1:n){
if (n%%x==0)
{y=c(y,n)}}}
print (y)

attempt fail

#attempt 3
n=1
x=1
y=c()
for (n in 1:5)
{for (x in 1:n){
if (n%%x==0)
{y=c(y,n)}}}
print (y)

result -  1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 5 5

#this is to eliminate the repetition of the numbers in the sequence
#attempt 4
